# SmartHomeWebApplication
This was a group class project. We created a web application that would create a username and password and store it in a database. We created a web page format with different options for a safehome web application. I worked on the alarm system part of the smarthome web app to where it would arm the house. This is the web page http://www.alejandronepro.com/smarthome/
